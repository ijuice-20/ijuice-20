Hey yo🤘, I'm Ijas Ahammed, currently working as the Software Engineer at [marketfeed (YC S21)](https://www.marketfeed.com/).
My debut into the tech was back in the days when torrenting and GTA Vice City ✨ were calling the shots worldwide 

I'm all about whipping up sleek mobile and web apps that just flow 🏂. I taught myself the ropes, so yeah, I'm that kind of developer who makes apps not just work, but look darn good too 🎯

Outside the tech realm, I'm a startup 🪫 aficionado with a penchant for creating connections. My roles as a Student Volunteer at IEDC GECT and Joint Convenor for the Summer Startup Festival 🏜️ during my college days exemplify my commitment to innovation

Apart from all these, I'm a HUGE* Messi🐐 fan who also loves playing video games 🎮 and watching movies 🎬 (alot)

So, let's connect, collaborate, and create wonders. Whether it's building beautiful apps, discussing the latest match, or dissecting the nuances of UI design, I'm here, ready to engage 🍻
