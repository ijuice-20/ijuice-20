Hey yoðŸ¤˜, I'm Ijas Ahammed, currently working as the Software Engineer at [marketfeed (YC S21)](https://www.marketfeed.com/).
My debut into the tech was back in the days when torrenting and GTA Vice City were calling the shots worldwide.

I'm all about whipping up sleek mobile and web apps that just flow. I taught myself the ropes, so yeah, I'm that kind of developer who makes apps not just work, but look darn good too.

Outside the tech realm, I'm a startup aficionado with a penchant for creating connections. My roles as a Student Volunteer at IEDC GECT and Joint Convenor for the Summer Startup Festival during my college days exemplify my commitment to innovation.

Apart from all these, I'm a HUGE* Messi fan who also loves playing video games and watching movies (alot).
