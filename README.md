Hey yoðŸ¤˜, I'm Ijas Ahammed, currently the much needed Software Engineer at marketfeed (YC S21).
I'm all about whipping up sleek mobile and web apps that just flow. I taught myself the ropes, so yeah, I'm that kind of developer who makes apps not just work, but look darn good too.

Outside the tech realm, I'm a startup aficionado with a penchant for creating connections. My roles as a Student Volunteer at IEDC GECT and Joint Convenor for the Summer Startup Festival during my college days exemplify my commitment to innovation.

Apart from all these, I'm a HUGE* Messi fan who loves playing games and watching movies (alot).
Fun fact: my debut into the tech was back in the days when torrenting and vice-city were calling the shots worldwide.
